# Route_42
The route of the 42 Academy\
To test some of the first projects you'll need to use *Community testers & guides like [paco || francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette)\
But don't worry. You will find it in the `README.md` section of each project.

# Ring 0
In the ring0 you're going to see the [libft](https://github.com/aseth0/Route_42/blob/main/Libft/README.md)\
The most common functions you'll need with this language, coded by yourself!\

# Ring 1
This is so interesting because you'll learn about memory management, buffers strings...\
And create a virtual machine to start your lab.\
